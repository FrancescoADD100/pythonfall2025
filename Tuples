"""Create a tuple named programming_classes with these classes: 'Intro to Python', 'Advanced Python', 'Database Essentials', 'Web Development Basics', 'Data Structures in Python', 'Web Design Fundamentals'.
Write a program that uses a for loop to print each class in the tuple.
Use the len function to print how many courses are in the tuple.
Make sure to use a main function for this program.
Try this out, and you'll understand how tuples work in Python well!"""
